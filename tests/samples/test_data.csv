just wanted another war they should have listened to him in 1938 hitler announced that germany was taking over austria great britain's leader at the time was neville chamberlain he just stepped aside and let hitler take over austria but churchill made speeches saying that great britain must prepare for war churchill realized that hitler planned to continue taking over europe next hitler decided to take over czechoslovakia he spread lies about how germans were treated in the country he also reminded germans that czechoslovakia was once part of germany it had been taken away after world war i at this point hitler met with prime minister chamberlain germany and great britain agreed not to go to war the german army marched into czechoslovakia with no shots fired churchill was outraged so were many other british people it appeared that great britain would not stop hitler chamberlain did not like how churchill was acting but the british people were starting to listen to churchill some of them felt he had been right all along hitler and the germans wanted to take over more land so hitler planned to attack poland prime minister chamberlain had said he would defend poland but hitler thought the british would give in like they had before there was still one threat in the way of hitler taking over poland it was the soviet leader joseph stalin hitler sent a secret telegram to stalin the telegram described the reasons hitler thought poland should be invaded hitler wrote that he wanted a new relationship with stalin he hoped that stalin would support him in just two days stalin told hitler that he would not interfere there was nothing stopping hitler now in 1939 hitler invaded poland this forced great britain to do something it did not want to do declare war world war ii had officially begun churchill could have said i told you so but he did not instead churchill worked to strengthen the british royal navy his leadership skills were clear in may 1940 chamberlain resigned churchill became the new prime minister many british people believed he was the only one who could unite and lead the nation at war churchill believed his job as great britain's leader was his destiny he said my whole life has been building towards this very moment he believed that all his past experiences made him the right leader to fight hitler churchill had a way of calming people's fears his speeches made people feel that they could win the war even in the face of defeat he rallied the british people those who did not like him in the past began to warm to him,60

backing down instead of listening other people said that churchill just wanted another war they should have listened to him in 1938 hitler announced that germany was taking over austria great britain's leader at the time was neville chamberlain he just stepped aside and let hitler take over austria but churchill made speeches saying that great britain must prepare for war churchill realized that hitler planned to continue taking over europe next hitler decided to take over czechoslovakia he spread lies about how germans were treated in the country he also reminded germans that czechoslovakia was once part of germany it had been taken away after world war i at this point hitler met with prime minister chamberlain germany and great britain agreed not to go to war the german army marched into czechoslovakia with no shots fired churchill was outraged so were many other british people it appeared that great britain would not stop hitler chamberlain did not like how churchill was acting but the british people were starting to listen to churchill some of them felt he had been right all along hitler and the germans wanted to take over more land so hitler planned to attack poland prime minister chamberlain had said he would defend poland but hitler thought the british would give in like they had before there was still one threat in the way of hitler taking over poland it was the soviet leader joseph stalin hitler sent a secret telegram to stalin the telegram described the reasons hitler thought poland should be invaded hitler wrote that he wanted a new relationship with stalin he hoped that stalin would support him in just two days stalin told hitler that he would not interfere there was nothing stopping hitler now in 1939 hitler invaded poland this forced great britain to do something it did not want to do declare war world war ii had officially begun churchill could have said i told you so but he did not instead churchill worked to strengthen the british royal navy his leadership skills were clear in may 1940 chamberlain resigned churchill became the new prime minister many british people believed he was the only one who could unite and lead the nation at war churchill believed his job as great britain's leader was his destiny he said my whole life has been building towards this very moment he believed that all his past experiences made him the right leader to fight hitler churchill had a way of calming people's fears his speeches made people feel that they could win the war even in the face of defeat he rallied the british people those who did not like him in the past began to warm to him,60
